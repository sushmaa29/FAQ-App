## Test Structure

### API Endpoint Tests  
ðŸ“Œ **File:** `tests/api.test.js`  

- âœ… Create FAQ  
- âœ… Retrieve all FAQs  
- âœ… Retrieve FAQ by ID  
- âœ… Update FAQ  
- âœ… Delete FAQ  

### Model Tests  
ðŸ“Œ **File:** `tests/model.test.js`  

- âœ… Tests for the `getTranslation` method of the FAQ model  

**Note:**  
If any test times out (e.g., due to a slow update operation), consider increasing the timeout in your test file by using a traditional function (not an arrow function) and calling:  

```js
this.timeout(10000);
